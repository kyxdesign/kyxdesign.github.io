                     <p>My name is Karolis, and I'm a multidisciplinary designer based in Vilnius, 
                        Lithuania. With a primary focus on branding, artwork, 3D, 
                        and web, I thrive on bringing creativity and innovation 
                        to every project I undertake. </p>
        
                        <p>Having spent three enriching years at Galaxy Racer, I've had the
                             privilege of contributing to a variety of projects and 
                             campaigns, leaving my mark on the visual identities of 
                             esteemed clients such as LaLiga Arab and Talent Lyfe </p>
        
                             <p>Currently, I am a student at Vilnius Tech, where I am studying 
                                Multimedia and Design. This educational journey allows me to deepen my understanding of
                                design principles and explore new avenues of creativity. </p>
